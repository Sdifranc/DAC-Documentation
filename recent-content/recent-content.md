# Recent Content

In DAC you can quickly navigate the contents that you visited \(Report, Page, Spaces, Document, Blog Post, and Task\) with the feature **Recent Contents**. You can view a list of the most recent content you have visited, and go back and forth among objects you last visited without having to search in your applications.

Below, a short video tutorial showing how to access and view Recent Content.

If you choose an item among **Area, Group, Initiative, Document, Blog Post, Page, Task, Report** and **User** you can filter the list by the item selected, so you can display all the content \(i.e. all Pages\) recently visited.

By choosing the item **Favorite** or **Special** you can filter the list based on the approval rating that you have expressed on the content.
