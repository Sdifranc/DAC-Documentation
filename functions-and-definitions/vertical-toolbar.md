# User Profile

DAC has an area dedicated to the user's personal profile, which includes information ranging from personal details to information on the user’s professional career.

The User profile in DAC makes it easier for you to run well-structured and constantly updated searches of colleagues’ expertise. This allows you to identify the users that can make a significant contribution to a project or initiative. Adding users and groups allows you to assign access privileges to individual users so they can view and work with each element of the app. It also enables you to create a collaboration team at DAC level.

Please remember that all the users available in DAC are instantiated in DAC-DS. DAC inherits the user and groups privileges of the app created in the DevBox. For more information, refer to the user and group privileges available in the DAC Starter Kit and in DAC-DS Manual. 

We invite you to read the DAC-DS manual in order to understand how to set privileges and permission. When you build your App in DAC-DS, by default, the page privileges are set to the “Everyone” group.  This means that all the users that are bound with DAC, will be granted access to the app.

To create new users in DAC-DS:

Click on “New” to create a new user.

Enter the user authentication data.

Select “Admin” if the new user needs privileges to modify apps in DS.

Once the users are created, you must associate users with a specific group in order to create privileges in each application project.

On the Starting Page, select the group management shortcut to open the wizard.

Click on “New” to create a new group.

Select the users you want to add in the right column, and then save.

You can manage your page in the same way as a CV in order to let the company know about your profile and allow it to be searched in accordance with specific criteria.

To access your profile, click on the profile image or name icon, or access your profile from the settings window in the User Profile item at the top.

The page consists of two separate areas:
