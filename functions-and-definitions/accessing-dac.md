# Accessing DAC

DAC is the user interface of DAC’s Design Studio. The DAC environment is a web-based analysis environment where apps created in DAC Design Studio are published.

You’ll first need to have your Design Studio administrator grant you access to DAC, and provide you with the URL from which to access your DAC environment on the web. Instructions for this are given in the Design Studio Manual.
