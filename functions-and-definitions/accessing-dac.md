# Accessing DAC

DAC is the user interface of DAC’s Design Studio. The DAC environment is a web-based analysis environment ~~in the Predix cloud~~ where apps created in DAC Design Studio are published.

~~Users access DAC by entering their Predix login credentials.~~ You’ll first need to have your Design Studio administrator grant you access to DAC, and provide you with the URL from which to access your DAC environment on the web. Instructions for this are given in the Design Studio Manual.

~~Once you have your Predix login credentials or UAA and the URL to access your DAC environment, a browser page with the login window appears. Log in using the Predix credentials provided to you or using the UAA credentials~~
