# Groups Administration

The Group Administration is a function enabled only for the User Administrator.

The group management window is activated from **Main Toolbar &gt;&gt; Administration &gt;&gt; Groups Administration.** 

The default "**Everyone**" group created by the system includes all users on the system and includes the permissions to access the application and display all objects of the application. Since the “Everyone” group is generated automatically by the system, you cannot rename it, move it or delete it from its Root.

DAC allows you to make the data reading schema dynamic for the user group. This schema is set during the creation of Cubes and Dimensions, on which the reports are then run.

On the user group, it is possible to customize the permissions on the objects, to enable the view of cubes, dimensions and metrics.

DAC enables or disables the execution of the web events.

The next video explain how to create a new group in DAC.
