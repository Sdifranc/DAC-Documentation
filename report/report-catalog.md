# Report Catalog\( in Progress\)

## **Overview**

You can open the report catalog of the application directly from the applications section on the Home Page. 

Once you open up the application, clicking the report button at the top right opens the application’s report catalog.

The report catalog contains all of the application’s reports, organized into folders and subfolders, in order to provide the user with a familiar interface.

The main folders are listed on the left:

* **Root:** This lists the folders containing the reports that are published and displayed to the user. Clicking on the folder, you will get a new visualization by list and not by icon. By selecting the items of the path you can browse backwards, to go back to the previous folders. 
* **My Reports:** You can choose whether to save the reports created or edited by a user in a specific folder.
