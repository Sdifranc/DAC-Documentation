# Report Toolbar

## 

The information in this section shows you how to create a new report and edit an existing report. To create a report select **Create&gt;&gt; Report** from the **Main Toolbar.**

DAC provides a number of functions that allow you to perform a more in-depth analysis. These enhancements are available by **adding or deleting new items**, shown in the figure below:



### Report Toolbar

The toolbar functions are subdivided into four sections.

Type of presentationReport printRestart and updateExporting report

·        The type of presentation of the report \(image, table, or both\)

·        The exporting of the report to PDF, Excel, or CSV.

·        **Printing** a report \(**Print**\), that is printed in PDF format \(therefore, the same operations can be performed as when exporting the PDF and then printing\).

**Compatibility issue**: if you are using version 9.4.2 or 9.4.3 of Adobe Acrobat Reader, immediate printing is not permitted. Instead, you will be prompted to save the report as a file. Only after saving will you be able to open and print it.

·        Updating the data \(**Reload data**\) or restoring the report to the published form \(**Reload report**\), based on the DAC caching rules.

The toolbar of the report can be hidden using the button and reopened with the button.

In the hidden form, the commands for printing and exporting \(to PDF, Excel and CSV\) remain available.

The publication of the reports may be configured by the administrator directly with the hidden toolbar, which will be enabled from the toolbar open button.

Some configurations also include publication without the toolbar; in these instances, the Open button will be absent.
