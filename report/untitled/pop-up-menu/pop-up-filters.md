# Pop-up Filters

The **Filter** menu item allows you to immediately filter the elements of the report. It is applied to the rows and columns of the report. Depending on the position the menu was opened from, the sub-items of the Filter menu will appear:

* _Remove_ selected rows \(or columns\) deletes the row;
* _View_ selected rows \(or columns\) applies a filter on the selected row, deleting the others;
* _Remove element_ and View object have the same type of behavior.
