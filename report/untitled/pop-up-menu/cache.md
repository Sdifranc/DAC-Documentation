# Cache

Reports are generally managed in a **cache system**, which increases the response performance. Cache may be generated from schedules configured at system level, or automatically at the first request of a user, which will make it available to all the others.

The cache is generated automatically only if the reports do not have immediate execution times \(typically for executions above 3 seconds\).

Date and time when the cache was created is shown next to the name of the report. By viewing this cache information, youâ€™ll know the period the displayed data refers to.
